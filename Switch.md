**Switch Statement Documentation:**

The provided code snippet is a JavaScript program that utilizes a `switch` statement to determine and execute specific actions based on the value of the variable `day`. The purpose of this program is to provide a plan for studying according to the day of the week.

### Code Explanation:

1. **Variable Initialization:**
    ```javascript
    const day = 'monday';
    ```
    - The variable `day` is declared and assigned the string value `'monday'`. This represents the day of the week for which the study plan needs to be generated.

2. **Switch Statement:**
    ```javascript
    switch (day) {
        // Cases for each day of the week
    }
    ```
    - The `switch` statement evaluates the value of the variable `day` and executes the code block associated with the matching case.

3. **Case Statements:**
    ```javascript
    case 'monday':
        console.log('plan to study(mon)');
        break;
    // ... (similar cases for other days)
    ```
    - Each `case` statement represents a specific day of the week.
    - If the value of `day` matches a particular case, the corresponding code block is executed.
    - In this example, if `day` is `'monday'`, it logs the message `'plan to study(mon)'`.

4. **Default Case:**
    ```javascript
    default:
        console.log('not a valid day');
    ```
    - The `default` case is executed when the value of `day` does not match any of the defined cases.
    - In this case, it logs the message `'not a valid day'`.

5. **Output:**
    - Depending on the value of `day`, the program outputs a specific study plan message for that day or indicates that the input is not a valid day.

### Example Output:
If `day` is `'monday'`, the output will be:
```
plan to study(mon)
```

If `day` is any other value not listed in the cases, the output will be:
```
not a valid day
```

### Additional Notes:
- The `break` statement is used to exit the `switch` statement after a case is executed.
- The program can be extended or modified by adding more cases for additional days or adjusting the study plan messages.
